            <p class="booksummary">
              World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler
              system for transforming your life. He knows that lasting change
              comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions -
              doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding
              a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.

            <p>By Yuval Noah Harari</p>
            <p class="booksummary">
              Earth is 4.5 billion years old. In just a fraction of that time,
              one species among countless others has conquered it: us. In this
              bold and provocative book, Yuval Noah Harari explores who we are,
              how we got here and where we're going.
